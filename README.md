Predictable Farm â€” Operating System / Yocto layer
---

> This repository is a fork of https://github.com/siemens/meta-iot2000.

See https://github.com/siemens/meta-iot2000/blob/master/README.md for general information and installation / building instructions.

The specific layer **meta-iot2000-AL** contains all the necessary recipes to run the Yocto distribution for Predictable Farm.

You must configure at least the following elements :

  - a private key and host file for the remote-shell package to work correctly (see `meta-iot2000-AL/recipes-example/remote-shell/files/`)
  - an update url for Yocto to fetch the initial Predictable farm SWU on boot (see `meta-iot2000-AL/recipes-example/predictable-farm/files/predictable-farm`)
