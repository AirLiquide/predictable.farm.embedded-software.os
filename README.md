### Introduction

The specific layer **meta-iot2000-AL** contains all the necessary recipes to run the Yocto distribution for Predictable Farm.

It is made for the IOT2000 flavour of the embedded software code.

You must configure at least the following elements :

  - an update url for Yocto to fetch the initial Predictable farm SWU on boot (see `meta-iot2000-AL/recipes-example/predictable-farm/files/predictable-farm`)

> The default password is "sopredictable" for user root
